## Introduction

Hi, I'm Akshara! I'm a rising senior at the [Liberal Arts and Science Academy](http://lasahighschool.org) in Austin, Texas. I've developed a passion for computer science, education, and womenâ€™s empowerment throughout high school. 

My most rewarding and memorable experiences throughout high school have come from my extracurricular involvement. I am the captain of my school's Science Olympiad team, President of Girls Giving Grants, President of LASA Ambassadors, Founder and President of the Women in Computer Science club, Founder of the STEMInnovation Program, and actively conduct scientific research. 

I've been featured by [KXAN](http://kxan.com/2017/03/28/austin-high-schooler-working-to-change-computer-science-field/), [ReigningIt](https://medium.com/@ReigningIt/women-who-reign-akshara-anand-95b1fb9b6a9c), [Inspirational Women's Series](https://inspirationalwomenseries.org/2017/01/20/inspirational-woman-interview-akshara-anand/), the [Daily Texan](https://www.dailytexanonline.com/2017/04/23/austin-high-schooler-seeks-to-get-more-women-involved-in-stem), and [Impact Austin](http://impactaustin.org/blog/post/girls-giving-grants-site-visits-finalize-2017-grantee) for my work in Women in Computer Science activities and community outreach. 

In my free time I love reading science and technology articles, running, spending time with family and friends, and immersing myself in music. You can email me at aksharasanand@gmail.com if you have any questions. :sparkles:
